Musk did not immediately respond to a request for comment.The Tesla CEO and owner of X, who has been spearheading efforts to slash the federal workforce and spending, also criticized judges who have issued rulings that paused Trump's executive actions. Democracy in America is being destroyed by judicial coup,Musk wrote in a separate post on X.The post on law firms focused on a ruling by U.S. District Judge Angel Kelley that temporarily blocked the administration's sharp cuts to federal grant funding for universities, medical centers and other research institutions.That lawsuit was brought in Boston by Democratic attorneys general from 22 U.S. states challenging cuts adopted by the National Institutes of Health. Two other related lawsuits related to NIH funding have been brought by groups represented by law firms Jenner & Block and Ropes & Gray.The two law firms, which did not immediately respond to requests for comment, are among more than eight large and medium sized U.S. law firms that have signed on to lawsuits against the Trump administration related to funding cuts, immigration restrictions and transgender rights.Many of the firms, including Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher, Hogan Lovells, Jenner & Block and Perkins Coie, are handling the cases without charge. The firms either declined to comment or did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Musk's post about law firms.Musk has used his social media megaphone in the past to criticize prominent law firms by name."
